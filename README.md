# FNP-Sales-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes sales performance data from Ferns N Petals (FNP) using Microsoft Excel to uncover business trends across time, categories, products, cities, occasions, and customer demographics. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into an interactive dashboard that provides actionable business insights through KPIs and dynamic visualizations.

The final output is a user-friendly Excel dashboard with slicers that allow stakeholders to filter results by order date, delivery date, and occasion for quick performance reviews and decision support.
